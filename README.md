# Magento.Net
This project has been created with the aim to create a robust tool written in VB.Net that will allow you to communicate with Magento directly from Windows.

The project aims to create such tools:
- Winforms UI to communicate with Magento
- SQL database that allows saving the data downloaded from Magento to transfer to the ERP system and transfer to Magento data downloaded from the ERP system
- Windows service that provides two-way communication between the SQL database and Magento

Any help and willingness to cooperate appreciated.
